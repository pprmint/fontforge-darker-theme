## Features.

* (C)lickable buttons.
* Redesigned icons.
* Darker than the next best dark theme for FontForge.

## Installation.

1. Copy all the files from the `pixmaps` folder into FontForgeÂ´s `pixmaps` directory. Keep a backup of it if you think you might want to revert back to the default icons.

The folder may be in one of the following locations:

*  `/Applications/FontForge.app/Contents/Resources/opt/local/share/fontforge/pixmaps/` - Mac
*  `C:\Program Files (x86)\FontForgeBuilds\share\fontforge\pixmaps\` - Windows
*  `/usr/share/fontforge/pixmaps/` - UNIX
*  `/usr/local/share/fontforge/pixmaps/` - UNIX

2. In FontForge open the `File > Preferences` dialog, and set the `ResourceFile` preference to the `darker.theme` file.
